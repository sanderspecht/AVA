There are people all over the world who buy or lease land to cultivate it, but increasingly people also buy or lease land to *restore its nature*. Some are millionaires. Others are local enthusiasts, still others are foundations or environmental organisations. Imagine a marketplace that serves such a regenerative purpose, where aquisitions only can happen, if both parties sign an agreemnt to improve the nature quality upon the sale or the lease of the land. The marketplace is built around an open source geographical information system (OpenGIS), where anyone can seek out plots of farmland on a map, get in contact with the owner, do the paperwork (electronically), and complete the acquisition.

This marketplace exists, and it is called [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) ("nature land" in Danish). Currently, it is being developed in Denmark by AVA tech in collaboration with GIS and environmental enthusiasts.

*Here's who use it:*
* **Landowners** (typically farmers) use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to find tenants or buyers of land. The areas are typically outcrops near streams and forests with rich wildlife or sandy soil types, slopes, and lowland soils that provide low yields but are ideal for natural land.
* **Non-profit foundations, companies, and private nature lovers** use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to buy large areas for nature restoration and nature protection.
* **Private investors, companies and private equity funds** use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to carry out sustainable investments in agriculture and forestry. When investing through [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/), you legally undertake to lease the areas for either nature restoration or a transition to sustainable forestry or regenerative agriculture such as organic or extensive farming, typically grazing or mowing.
* **Tenants** can be anyone, perhaps yourself? Tenants will be able to use the marketplace to rent one hectare of land for typically less than DKK 5.000 per. year. Several people may also join together, and in this way, it costs a small annual amount for private citizens to incentivize landowners and investors to create or improve natural habitats.
* Finally, **organic farmers, sustainable foresters, hunters, self-sufficients, holiday home landlords, or associations** can even obtain dividends from the rented land, as long as this is achieved in a sustainable way in compliance with the signed sales contract/tenancy agreement.

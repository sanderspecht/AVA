The marketplace [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) allows farmers and landowners to easily sell parcels of unsuitable farmland with the target of restoring nature in the area instead.

Across the globe people increasingly buy land not to cultivate it, but to *restore and preserve its nature*. Some are millionaires, others are local groups, still others are foundations or environmental organisations. Common for them is the realization that nature is in crisis and that it is worth employing capital to save it.

At the same time, farmers are interested in selling off the small parcels of land that are unsuitable for agriculture, e.g. carbon-rich lowland soils, sandy soils, or slopes.

When selling or buying land on [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) the parties enter into a legal agreement that ensures a significant and lasting improvement of the nature of the land in question.

**Technical solution**  
Farmers and landowners can sell small parcels or large land areas in the marketplace, while potential buyers will be able to search for plots for sale in an interactive map developed in QGIS. Through this interface, potential buyers can evaluate specific fields' suitability for nature restoration, e.g. in terms of possible habitat restorations or CO2 reductions.

In the interactive map each field has a colour that represents its level of suitability for nature restoration. The colour scale is based on an index consisting of the following factors:
<ul>
  <li>biodiversity and habitats,</li>
  <li>lowland soils,</li>
  <li>groundwater,</li>
  <li>soil type,</li>
  <li>and terrain.</li>
</ul>
 This is then coupled with a layer showing all agriculture fields. Finally, a layer incorporates economic GIS data (ownership, land value, etc.). The end result is an interactive map that displays *exactly* which fields are the most suitable for nature restoration and the option to contact the owner.


**The idea behind**  
The faster we accept that nature has been seized by man through property rights, the faster we can develop solutions that incentivize landowners to ensure biodiversity, protect habitats, protect the groundwater, and reduce CO2 emissions on *each and every* plot of land.



*Here's who will use the marketplace:*  
* **Landowners** (typically farmers) use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to find tenants or buyers of land. The areas are typically outcrops near streams and forests with rich wildlife or sandy soil types, slopes, and lowland soils that provide low yields but are ideal for natural land.
* **Non-profit foundations, companies, and private nature lovers** use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to buy large areas for nature restoration and nature protection.
* **Private investors, companies and private equity funds** use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to carry out sustainable investments in agriculture and forestry. When investing through [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/), you legally undertake to lease the areas for either nature restoration or a transition to sustainable forestry or regenerative agriculture such as organic or extensive farming, typically grazing or mowing.
* **Tenants** can be anyone, perhaps yourself? Tenants will be able to use the marketplace to rent one hectare of land for typically less than DKK 5.000 per. year. Several people may also join together, and in this way, it costs a small annual amount for private citizens to incentivize landowners and investors to create or improve natural habitats.
* Finally, **organic farmers, sustainable foresters, hunters, self-sufficients, holiday home landlords, or associations** can even obtain dividends from the rented land, as long as this is achieved in a sustainable way in compliance with the signed sales contract/tenancy agreement.

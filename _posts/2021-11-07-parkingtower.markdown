Let's reclaim the streets by rethinking urban parking. Imagine if we set up parking towers in close proximity to people's homes. Here, a robotic arm automatically and securely parks or collects each car in a matter of seconds. Cars can also be recharged, if they are electric. The technical solution already exists in Wolkswagen's headquarters and factory in Wolfsburg. So, it is just a matter of fitting the technical solution into an urban environment and create a cost-efficient, consumer-centered financial setup that is attractive to citizens and urban decision makers alike.

We know that plants suck chemicals out of the air. Specificially, they absorb toxins into their leaves, transmitting them to their roots, where pollutants are transformed into a source of plant food. Moreover, they emit water vapours creating a pumping action to suck in dirty air. Once again, nature provide us with the answer. By greening the whole surface of each parking structure, we create large natural air profiers that are evenly distributed across our cities.

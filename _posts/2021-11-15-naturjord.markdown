There are people all over the world who buy or lease land to cultivate it, but increasingly people also buy or lease land to *restore its nature*. Some are millionaires. Others are local enthusiasts, still others are foundations or environmental organisations.

Imagine a marketplace that serves a regenerative purpose, where aquisitions can only happen on the condition that both parties sign a legal agreement to improve the nature quality upon the sale/lease of the land, possibly with added benefits such as public support for full natural restoration.

The marketplace is based on the open source QGIS geographical information system, and the idea is that anyone can seek out plots of land on a unique map, get a sense of the possibilities from regenerating nature in specific areas, get in contact with the owner of the land, fill in electronic paperwork, and complete the acquisition.

And the good news: This marketplace already exists. It is called [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) ("nature land" in Danish), and it is currently being developed in Denmark by AVA tech in collaboration with GIS experts and environmental enthusiasts.

*Here's who will use the marketplace:*
* **Landowners** (typically farmers) use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to find tenants or buyers of land. The areas are typically outcrops near streams and forests with rich wildlife or sandy soil types, slopes, and lowland soils that provide low yields but are ideal for natural land.
* **Non-profit foundations, companies, and private nature lovers** use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to buy large areas for nature restoration and nature protection.
* **Private investors, companies and private equity funds** use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to carry out sustainable investments in agriculture and forestry. When investing through [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/), you legally undertake to lease the areas for either nature restoration or a transition to sustainable forestry or regenerative agriculture such as organic or extensive farming, typically grazing or mowing.
* **Tenants** can be anyone, perhaps yourself? Tenants will be able to use the marketplace to rent one hectare of land for typically less than DKK 5.000 per. year. Several people may also join together, and in this way, it costs a small annual amount for private citizens to incentivize landowners and investors to create or improve natural habitats.
* Finally, **organic farmers, sustainable foresters, hunters, self-sufficients, holiday home landlords, or associations** can even obtain dividends from the rented land, as long as this is achieved in a sustainable way in compliance with the signed sales contract/tenancy agreement.

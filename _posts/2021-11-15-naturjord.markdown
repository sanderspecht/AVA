There are people all over the world who buy and either cultivate or restore agricultural land. Some are millionaires. Others are local enthusiasts, still others are foundations and various green organizations. Imagine a portal built around an open source geographical information system (OpenGIS), where anyone can seek out plots of farmland and get in contact with the owner regarding a possible acquisition. Then imagine that aquisitions can only happen through the portal, if the parties sign to improve the nature quality, e.g. the groundwater conditions or the bird life in the area. This portal is called [Naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) (literally "nature land"), and it is currently being developed in Denmark.

Here are the involved parties in the simple economic model:
* **Landowners** (typically farmers) use Naturjord to find tenants or buyers of land and nature areas. The areas are typically outcrops near streams and forests with rich wildlife or sandy soil types, slopes, and lowland soils that provide low yields but are ideal for natural land.
* **Non-profit foundations, companies, and private nature lovers** use Naturjord to buy large areas for nature restoration and nature protection.
* **Private investors, companies and private equity funds** use Naturjord to carry out sustainable investments in agriculture and forestry. When investing through Naturjord, you legally undertake to lease the areas for either nature restoration or a transition to sustainable forestry or regenerative agriculture such as organic or extensive farming, typically grazing or mowing.
* **Tenants** could be anyone, perhaps you? Tenants will be able to use this platform to rent one hectare of land for typically less than DKK 5.000 per. year. You can also be several people that join together. In this way, with a small annual amount, you can help incentivize landowners and investors to ensure rich natural habitats.
* Finally, If you are an **organic farmer, sustainable forester, hunter, self-sufficient, holiday landlord, or association**, you can even obtain dividends from the land you rent or own, as long as this is achieved in a sustainable way in compliance with the agreement that you signed upon buying or leasing the land.

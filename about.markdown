Mitigating climate change and protecting and restoring ecosystems is an opportunity for the world to set in motion a new development of creativity, imagination, and sustainable prosperity.

AVA tech is a team of people across disciplines who cannot help themselves from designing solutions that may counter biodiversity loss, climate change, and water scarcity.

Our solutions currently range from wave energy converters and sustainable finance to architectural and apparel designs. There is no knowing which solution may come next.

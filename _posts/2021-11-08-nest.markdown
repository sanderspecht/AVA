Imagine a perforated platform that sits among the treetops, elevated by high stilts. A stairway leads campers to the platform, which measures e.g. 4 x 5 metres and has a soft top-layer that is weather resistant. Here, the campers can pitch their own tent for the night, by attaching special tent pegs into the holes in the perforated platform. Platforms like this could be placed among treetops in forests all over and provide free natural camping experiences for anyone with a tent. The design takes up virtually no space on the ground and allows for both rain an sunlight to reach the undergrowth below the platform.

Other types of elevated structures:
* **Cottage:** A small cottage on high stilts that will not disturb the surrounding nature and be more robust in tough weather conditions.
* **Hotel:** A group of cabins and common areas on stilts connected by footbridges as illustrated below:

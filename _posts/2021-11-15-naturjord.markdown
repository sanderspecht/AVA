AVA Visions has developed the marketplace [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/), where farmers and landowners sell parcels of land to buyers who wish to restore nature in the area.

Increasingly, people across the globe buy land not to cultivate it, but to *restore and preserve its nature*. Some are millionaires, others are local companies, still others are foundations or environmental organisations. Common for them all is the realization that nature is in crisis and is worth saving through smart and simple employment of capital.

At the same time, farmers are interested in selling off parcels of land that are unsuitable for agriculture, e.g. carbon-rich lowland soils, sandy soils, or slopes.

When selling or buying land via [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) both parties engage in a legal agreement, which as a minimum ensures a significant improvement of the nature quality upon the sale/lease of the land.


**Technical solution**  
Farmers and landowners can sell parcels of their land via the marketplace, and potential buyers will be able to search for an see the plots in an interactive map developed in QGIS. Through this interface, the potential buyer can evaluate the suitability for nature restoration of specific fields, e.g. in terms of possible habitat restorations or CO2 reductions.

In the interactive map each and every farmland is given a colour representing its level of suitability for nature restoration. The colour scale is based on an index consisting of the following factors: biodiversity and habitats, lowland soils, groundwater, soil type, and terrain. This is then coupled with a layer showing all agriculture fields. Finally, a layer incorporates economic GIS data (ownership, land value, etc.). The end result is an interactive map that displays *exactly* which fields are the most suitable for nature restoration and the option to contact the owner.


**The idea behind**  
The faster we accept that nature has been seized by man through property rights, the faster we can develop solutions that incentivize landowners to ensure biodiversity, protect habitats, protect the groundwater, and reduce CO2 emissions on on *each and every* plot of land.

*Here's who will use the marketplace:*  
* **Landowners** (typically farmers) use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to find tenants or buyers of land. The areas are typically outcrops near streams and forests with rich wildlife or sandy soil types, slopes, and lowland soils that provide low yields but are ideal for natural land.
* **Non-profit foundations, companies, and private nature lovers** use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to buy large areas for nature restoration and nature protection.
* **Private investors, companies and private equity funds** use [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/) to carry out sustainable investments in agriculture and forestry. When investing through [naturjord](https://naturjord.dk/), you legally undertake to lease the areas for either nature restoration or a transition to sustainable forestry or regenerative agriculture such as organic or extensive farming, typically grazing or mowing.
* **Tenants** can be anyone, perhaps yourself? Tenants will be able to use the marketplace to rent one hectare of land for typically less than DKK 5.000 per. year. Several people may also join together, and in this way, it costs a small annual amount for private citizens to incentivize landowners and investors to create or improve natural habitats.
* Finally, **organic farmers, sustainable foresters, hunters, self-sufficients, holiday home landlords, or associations** can even obtain dividends from the rented land, as long as this is achieved in a sustainable way in compliance with the signed sales contract/tenancy agreement.

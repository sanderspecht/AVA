Imagine biofabricated clothing made from mycelium (mushroomâ€™s root-like structure) in a design consisting of numerous small plates of equilateral triangles attached to each other. Finally, imagine a modular design, where a shirt, a scarf, or a skirt can be disassembled and reassembled by the wearer, so a new design is accomplished without discarding the old clothes. That is our vision for the garments of the near future.

Let's reclaim the streets by rethinking urban parking. Imagine if we set up parking spots in close proximity to people's homes. Here, a robotic arm automatically and securely parks or collects each car underground in a matter of seconds. Cars can also be recharged while they are parked. To avoid collosal buildings that create shadows, most of the parking facility is underground. The technical solution already exists in Wolkswagen's headquarters and factory in Wolfsburg. So, it is simply a matter of fitting the technical solution into an urban environment and create a cost-efficient, consumer-centered financial setup that is attractive to citizens and urban decision makers.

By greening the surface of each parking facility with a self-sustained vertical garden, the facilities becomes large natural air purifiers that are evenly distributed across cities.

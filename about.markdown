**AVA** is a design studio engaged in systemic nature-based solutions and regenerative business models.

We believe that the ecological crises of our time represent an opportunity for humanity to embark on a trajectory of creativity, collective imagination, and sustainable prosperity.

Our visions and solutions currently range from a market place for nature restoration to wave energy converters and architectural structures. There is no knowing what comes next.

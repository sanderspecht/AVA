This wave energy converter consists of numerous metre-long racks with buoys at the end, which are moved up and down by waves. Each rack turns a pinion, which is connected to a central flywheel. The flywheel smoothens out the fluctuating mechanical energy from the waves and runs a 3-phase AC generator that produces electricity, which is carried to land via subsea cables.
